            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>Activated sludge process is a process for treating sewage and industrial wastewaters using air
                    and biological floc composed of bacteria and protozoans. The process involves air or oxygen being
                    introduced into a mixture of primary treated or screened sewage or industrial wastewater (called
                    wastewater from now on) combined with organisms to develop a biological floc which reduces the
                    organic content of the sewage. This material, which in healthy sludge is a brown floc, is largely
                    composed of saprotrophic bacteria but also has an important protozoan flora mainly composed of
                    amoebae, Spirotrichs, Peritrichs including Vorticellids and a range of other filter feeding
                    species.
                    <br>  Other important constituents include motile and sedentary Rotifers. In poorly managed
                    activated sludge, a range of mucilaginous filamentous bacteria can develop including Sphaerotilus
                    natans which produces a sludge that is difficult to settle and can result in the sludge blanket
                    decanting over the weirs in the settlement tank to severely contaminate the final effluent quality.
                    This material is often described as sewage fungus but true fungal

                    communities are relatively uncommon. The combination of wastewater and biological mass is commonly
                    known as mixed liquor. In all activated sludge plants, once the wastewater has received sufficient
                    treatment, excess mixed liquor is discharged into settling tanks and the treated supernatant is run
                    off to undergo further treatment before discharge. Part of the settled material, the sludge, is
                    returned to the head of the aeration system to re-seed the new wastewater entering the tank. This
                    fraction of the floc is called return activated sludge (R.A.S.). Excess sludge is called surplus
                    activated sludge(S.A.S.) or waste activated sludge(W.A.S). S.A.S is removed from the treatment
                    process to keep the ratio of biomass to food supplied in the wastewater in balance.  S.A.S is stored
                    in sludge tanks and is further treated by digestion, either under anaerobic or aerobic conditions
                    prior to disposal. Many sewage treatment plants use axial flow pumps to transfer nitrified mixed
                    liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification. These pumps are often referred
                    to asinternal mixed liquor recycle pumps (IMLR pumps). The raw sewage, the RAS, and the nitrified
                    mixed liquor are mixed by submersible mixers in the anoxic zones in order to achieve
                    denitrification.Activated sludge is also the name given to the active biological material produced
                    by activated sludge plants

                <p>The Moving bed Bioreactor (MBBR) an economically solution is offered for wastewater treatment if the
                    "bulk" of the pollution load must be disposed of (as means of cost reduction) or if applicable
                    discharge regulations are not as strict. With this application we offer advanced wastewater
                    treatment solutions for the industrial and municipal markets. These solutions significantly increase
                    the capacity and efficiency of existing wastewater treatment plants, while minimizing the size of
                    new plant deployments. This method makes it possible to attain good efficiency results of disposal
                    with low energy consumption. This process is used for the removal of organic substances,
                    nitrification and denitrification. The MBBR system consists of an activated sludge aeration system
                    where the sludge is collected on recycled plastic carriers. These carriers have an internal large
                    surface for optimal contact water, air and bacteria

                <p>Sequencing batch reactors (SBR) or sequential batch reactors are industrial processing tanks for the
                    treatment of wastewater. SBR reactors treat waste water such as sewage or output from anaerobic
                    digesters or mechanical biological treatment facilities in batches. Oxygen is bubbled through the
                    waste water to reduce biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) to make
                    suitable for discharge into sewers or for use on land. While there are several configurations of
                    SBRs the basic process is similar. The installation consists of at least two identically equipped
                    tanks with a common inlet, which can be switched between-them.  The tanks have a “flow through”
                    system, with raw wastewater (influent) coming in at one end and treated water (effluent) flowing out
                    the other. While one tank is in settle/decant mode the other is aerating and filling. At the inlet
                    is a section of the tank known as the bio-selector. This consists of a series of walls or baffles
                    which direct the flow either from side to side of the tank or under and over consecutive baffles.
                    This helps to mix the incoming Influent and the returned activated sludge, beginning the biological
                    digestion process before the liquor enters the main part of the tank.

                <p>Submerged Aerobic Fixed Film Reactor is a cost-effective method of waste water treatment and sewage
                    sanitation that is primarily used in residential and commercial complexes. This equipment primarily
                    works on the three stages that are Primary Settlement, Secondary Treatment and Final Settlement /
                    Clarification. Within the wastewater industry, SAFF Technology is seen as the simplest and most cost
                    effective method of commercial and residential sewage sanitation / waste water treatment,
                    particularly for small to medium sized treatment plants where available land is limited, and where
                    full time operational manning would be uneconomical. A well-built Submerged Aerated Filter plant has
                    no moving parts within its main process zones, any serviceable items will be positioned to access

                <p>Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is the combination of a membrane process like microfiltration or
                    ultrafiltration with a suspended growth bioreactor, and is now widely used for municipal and
                    industrial wastewater treatment. When used with domestic wastewater, MBR processes could produce
                    effluent of high quality enough to be discharged to coastal, surface or brackish

                    waterways or to be reclaimed for urban irrigation. Other advantages of MBRs over conventional
                    processes include small footprint, easy retrofit and upgrade of old wastewater treatment-plants. It
                    is possible to operate MBR processes at higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations
                    compared to conventional settlement separation systems, thus reducing the reactor volume to achieve
                    the same loading rate. Two MBR configurations exist: internal/submerged, where the membranes are
                    immersed in and integral to the biological reactor; and external/side stream, where membranes are a
                    separate unit process requiring an intermediate pumping step.

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>The Up flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Reactor (UASB) is a single tank process. Wastewater enters the
                    reactor from the bottom, and flows upward. A suspended sludge blanket filters and treats the
                    wastewater as the wastewater flows through it. The sludge blanket is comprised of microbial
                    granules, i.e. small agglomerations (0.5 to 2mm in diameter) of microorganisms that, because of
                    their weight, resist being washed out in the up flow. The microorganisms in the sludge layer degrade
                    organic compounds. As a result, gases (methane and carbon dioxide) are released. The rising bubbles
                    mix the sludge without the assistance of any mechanical parts.   Sloped walls deflect material that
                    reaches the top of the tank downwards. The clarified effluent is extracted from the top of the tank
                    in an area above the sloped walls. After several weeks of use, larger granules of sludge form which
                    in turn act as filters for smaller particles as the effluent rises through the cushion of sludge.
                    Because of the up flow regime, granule-forming organisms are preferentially accumulated as the
                    others are washed out. The gas that rises to the top is collected in a gas collection dome and can
                    be used as energy (biogas). An up flow velocity of 0.6 to 0.9m/h must be maintained to keep the
                    sludge blanket in suspension.
