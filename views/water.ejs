            <p>
                Water covers 70.9% of the Earth’s surface, and is vital for all known forms of life. On Earth, 96.5% of
                the planet's water is found in oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in glaciers and the ice caps of
                Antarctica and Greenland, a small fraction in other large water bodies, and 0.001% in
                the air as vapor, clouds (formed of solid and liquid water particles suspended in air), and
                precipitation. Only 2.5% of the Earth's water is freshwater, and 98.8% of that water is in ice and
                groundwater. Less than 0.3% of all freshwater is in rivers, lakes, and the atmosphere, and an even
                smaller amount of the Earth's freshwater (0.003%) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured
                products.
            </p>
            <p>
                Water on Earth moves continually through the hydrological cycle of evaporation and transpiration
                (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. Evaporation and
                transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land.
            </p>
            <p>Safe drinking water is essential to humans and other life forms. Access to safe drinking water has
                improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people
                still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation. There is a
                clear correlation between access to safe water and GDP per capital. However, some observers have
                estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability.
                A recent report (November 2009) suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water
                demand will exceed supply by 50%. Water plays an important role in the world economy, as it functions as
                a solvent for a wide variety of chemical substances and facilitates industrial cooling and
                transportation. Approximately 70% of the fresh water used by humans goes to agriculture. Picturing water
                as a liquid that can form two types of structure, one tetrahedral and the other disordered, could
                explain many of its unusual properties. Heating reduces the number of ordered, tetrahedral structures in
                favor of a more disordered arrangement in which molecules are more densely packed. . Water has an
                exceptionally high specific heat capacity. it takes a lot of heat energy to raise water's temperature by
                a given amount. Specific heat capacity is at a minimum at 35 °C but increases as the temperature falls
                or rises, whereas the heat capacity of most other liquids rises continuously with temperature. Water's
                compressibility drops with increasing temperature until it reaches a minimum at 46 °C, whereas in most
                liquids, the compressibility rises continuously with temperature. . Water molecules diffuse more easily,
                not less easily, at higher pressures. Unlike many liquids, water becomes less viscous, not more viscous,
                at higher pressures. . Properties such as viscosity, boiling point and melting point are significantly
                different in "heavy" water - made from the heavier hydrogen isotopes. .The thermal conductivity of ice
                falls with increasing pressure....all these things focus to a point “WATER IS
                PRECIOUS”.....................

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>Water is so important for all of us as a part of surviving as part of life on this Earth. Ancient
                    civilizations like Indus River Valley, Egyptian, Greek, Native American, etc. have created myths and
                    legends to highlight the importance of this element for us all.  Within Hindu Mythology we hear odes
                    to river goddesses like Ganges; within Roman Mythology Neptune is the Lord of the Seas, Aborigine
                    tribes recall their totemic origins from water spirits, etc. In monotheist religions water
                    constitutes a link with God.  In the Old Testament it is the instrument used by God to punish (the
                    Flood) or save (the Crossing of the Red Sea). And even till now, water is a symbol of purity and
                    rebirth for the Christians, hence the reason for baptizing children in the holy waters. For the
                    Muslims the

                    spring in which Ismaël, son of Abraham and Agar, quenched his thirst has become a holy place. Water
                    unceasingly changes shapes and transforms itself. It is thus a model out of which everything can be
                    born. Water, consequently, becomes a symbol of fertility that can be found in all the myths and all
                    the religions. Beings and things are born of water.  Water also possesses medicinal virtues. Some
                    waters are recognized miraculous powers capable of healing the bodies. It is also a source of
                    purification- for the individual beings but also for the whole of mankind. </p>

            <hr>
            <div class="col-md-9">
                <p>Water has a central place in the practices and beliefs of many religions for two main reasons. 
                    Firstly, water cleanses.  Water washes away impurities and pollutants, it can make an object look as
                    good as new and wipe away any signs of previous defilement. Water not only purifies objects for
                    ritual use, but can make a person clean, externally or spiritually, ready to come into the presence
                    of his/her focus of worship.  Secondly, water is a primary building block of life.  Without water
                    there is no life, yet water has the power to destroy as well as to create.  We are at the mercy of
                    water just as we are at the mercy of our God or goddess.  The significance of water manifests itself
                    differently in different religions and beliefs but it is these two qualities of water that underlie
                    its place in our cultures and faiths.

            <div class="col-md-9">
                <p>For Buddhists symbolism and ritual is pointless because they seek spiritual enlightenment that comes
                    from seeing the reality of unreality.  Bodhidharma, thought to be the first teacher of Zen Buddhism
                    said this in the 5th Century CE:
                    "This mind is the Buddha.  I don't talk about precepts, devotions or ascetic practices such as
                    immersing yourself in water and fire, treading a wheel of knives, eating one meal a day, or never
                    lying down.  These are fanatical, provisional teachings.  Once you recognise your moving,
                    miraculously aware nature, yours is the mind of all buddhas."
                    Water does however feature in Buddhist funerals where water is poured into a bowl placed before the
                    monks and the dead body.  As it fills and pours over the edge, the monks recite  "As the rains fill
                    the rivers and overflow into the ocean, so likewise may what is given here reach the departed."

                <p>Almost all Christian churches or sects have an initiation ritual involving the use of water.  Baptism
                    has its origins in the symbolism of the Israelites being led by Moses out of slavery in
                    Egypt through the Red Sea and from the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist in the Jordan.  After
                    Jesus' resurrection he commanded his disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
                    Spirit (Matthew 28:19-20).  Baptism is regarded differently in different denominations within
                    Christendom.

                <p>Water in Hinduism has a special place because it is believed to have spiritually cleansing powers. 
                    To Hindus all water is sacred, especially rivers, and there are seven sacred rivers, namely the
                    Ganges, Yamuna, Godavari, Sarasvati, Narmada, Sindhu and Kaveri.  Although Hinduism encompasses so
                    many different beliefs among those that most Hindus do share is the importance of striving to attain
                    purity and avoiding pollution.  This relates to both physical cleanliness and spiritual well-being.

                <p>In Islam water is important for cleansing and purifying.  Muslims must be ritually pure before
                    approaching God in prayer.  Some mosques have a courtyard with a pool of clear water in the center,
                    but in most mosques the ablutions are found outside the walls.  Fountains symbolizing purity are
                    also sometimes found in mosques.  In Islam ritual purity (called tahara) is required before carrying
                    out religious duties especially salat (worship).
                    There are three kinds of ablutions.  Firstly, ghusl, the major ablution, is the washing of the whole
                    body in pure water, after declaring the intention to do so.  Muslims are obliged to
                    perform ghusl after sex which incurs a state of major ritual impurity.  Ghusl is also recommended
                    before the Friday prayer, the two main feasts, and before touching the Koran.  Ghusl must be done
                    for the dead before they are buried.
